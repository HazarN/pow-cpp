Certainly! Below is a README file template for your logarithmic time power function repository:

Logarithmic Time Power Function
This repository contains an implementation of a logarithmic time power function written in C++. This function efficiently calculates the power of a given base to a specified exponent using a logarithmic time complexity approach.

Introduction
The power function power(double a, int n) in this repository computes 
�
�
a 
n
  where 
�
a is the base and 
�
n is the exponent. The implementation is optimized for performance, achieving logarithmic time complexity (
�
(
log
⁡
�
)
O(logn)).

Features
Efficient computation of power with logarithmic time complexity.
Support for both positive and negative exponents.
Handles edge cases such as 
�
=
0
n=0 and 
�
=
1
n=1 for quick termination.
Minimal space complexity.
Usage
To use the power function in your C++ project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/your-username/logn-time-pow.git
Include the power.cpp file in your project.

Call the power() function with the base and exponent parameters.

cpp
Kodu kopyala
double result = power(base, exponent);
Example
cpp
Kodu kopyala
#include <iostream>

// Include the power function implementation
#include "power.cpp"

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double base;
    int exponent;

    // Input base and exponent from the user
    cout << "Enter base: "; cin >> base;
    cout << "Enter exponent: "; cin >> exponent;

    // Calculate the power and display the result
    cout << base << " raised to the power of " << exponent << " is: " << power(base, exponent) << endl;

    return 0;
}
